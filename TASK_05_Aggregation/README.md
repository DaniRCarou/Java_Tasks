Specifications for exercise 2:

Create the Book and Author classes

1. The Author and Book classes will be located in the com.itt.libreria package, while the Main class, where you will include the main method, will be the root of the project.
2. Each class must have its constructor with parameters to receive values ​​for all properties.
3. All properties of both classes must be private and accessible through get/set methods.
4. The toString() method of both classes should return a text string with the state of the object (values ​​of all properties). You can create it automatically with the help of Eclipse.
5. You must also create the Main class, with the main method, where you will create an object of type Author and another object of type Book, to which the Author object will be passed as one of the constructor arguments. You will perform the following operations with the Book object:

   - Invokes the toString() method of the new Book object.
   - Modify the author's biography through the Book object you created.
   - Invoke the toString() method of the Author object that you created in two different ways: from the reference to the Book object and from the reference to the Author object that you created.
   - Modify the value of the gender property and call the toString() method again to see the changes.
