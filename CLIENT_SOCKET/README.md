These are two examples of how to communicate a client application to a server application. 

**1. ClientSocket class**: We are going to see how we can collect two numbers from a client application and send them to the server (Project: SERVER_SOCKET -> Server_Socket.java) so that it returns a response with the result of the sum of both.

**2. RepetitiveClientSocket class**: The second example is very similar to the previous example, but in this case the client application will send numbers continuously to the server (Project: SERVER_SOCKET -> Server_Socket.java) until the client decides to stop through the client application.
