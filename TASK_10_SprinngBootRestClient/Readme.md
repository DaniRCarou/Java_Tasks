###This is the third requirement shown in the task_09 statement. It is a Spring Boot project with Spring web starter


In this task, I am going to create the client application, built with Spring Boot, that will consume the Spring Boot service (TASK_09_SpringBootRest). 
Being a Spring Boot application, it will be deployed on a server. Therefore, it will have to have a different configuration port (8081) than the TASK_09_SpringBootRest project (8080).

#Requirement 3

It is requested to create a Java application capable of interacting with the video game REST server. The application will display a menu capable of performing all server operations, such as:

    Create a new video game
    Remove a video game by ID
    Modify a video game by ID
    Retrieve a video game by ID
    List all video games
    Exit

For each option, the necessary data will be requested from the user and/or relevant results will be displayed. The application will run until the "exit" option is selected.


#Considerations

For the entire activity, clarity of code, modularity, efficiency of employed algorithms, and explanatory comments on key points of the application (JavaDoc or regular comments, whichever is deemed more appropriate) will be evaluated.

The use of GITHUB for group work is recommended.

For submission, compress the source code and upload it to the platform, including a PDF document with everything necessary to demonstrate the correct functioning of the activity (results, screenshots, files, photos, etc.). The PDF document does not need to be extensive but should include, at a minimum, screenshots of the obtained results and an explanation of the key points of the activity performed. It is also acceptable to submit the PDF with the URL providing access to the GITHUB repository without including the source code.
