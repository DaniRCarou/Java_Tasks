Exercise 1 / BasicElements

Declare a variable called num1 and assign it a random value from 1 to 20. Then declare another variable called num2. If num1 is between 5 and 15 (inclusive), it assigns the result of the num1+15 operation to num2, otherwise it assigns the result of the num1+5 operation to num2. At the end it shows the value of both variables on the screen.

Exercise 2 / ControlStructures

We need to count in reverse order of 10 by 10 from 100 to 10 (100, 90, 80, …, 10). Create two Java programs, each with two different control structures, that perform the indicated task.

Exercise 3 / ControlStructures2

Create a Java program that generates a random number between 1 and 10. Once generated, if the number is greater than 5, it will display the message “Today is going to be a great day”, otherwise it will display the message “Today "It's going to be the best day in the world."

Exercise 4 / ControlStructures3

Create a Java program that generates random numbers between 1 and 10. Each generated number must be displayed on the screen, ending when the number 7 is generated. The program must also report how many numbers had to be generated to obtain the 7.

Exercise 5 / ControlElements4

Create a Java program that generates a random number between 1 and 5. Once generated, you must use a multiple alternative structure (switch) to write a different text string on the screen, depending on the number generated.
