This is an example of how to communicate a client application to a server application. 

**1.** We are going to see how we can collect two numbers from a client application (Project: **CLIENT_SOCKET/client/ClientSocket.java**) and send them to the server application (Project: **SERVER_SOCKET/server/Server_Socket.java**) so that it returns a response with the result of the sum of both.

**2.** The second example is very similar to the previous example, but in this case the client application (Project: **CLIENT_SOCKET/client/RepetitiveClientSocket.java**) will send numbers continuously to the server application (Project: **SERVER_SOCKET/server/Server_Socket.java**) until the client decides to stop through the client application.
